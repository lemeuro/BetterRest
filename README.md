# BetterRest

A project to calculate the optimal sleep time depending on the number of cups of coffee you drink.

This is a simple portfolio project based on machine learning and the CoreML framework.

In addition to basic machine learning functions such as the "predict" function, the project uses a form and some simple basic Views for the form. The project also involves working with dates and date components.
